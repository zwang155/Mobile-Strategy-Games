	<h1>Final Porject for Data Visualization -- Mobile Strategy Games</h1>

	<p>Author: Ziling Wang</p>
	<p>Project Description:<br>
		As mobile phones plays a significant role in our daily lives nowadays,
		the mobile games industry is becoming more and more popular.<br>
		This project is going to do a deep dive into a dataset with multiple synchronized visualizations.<br>
		<br>
		The topic is mobile strategy games.<br>
		And this
		<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/tristan581/17k-apple-app-store-strategy-games">dataset</a>
		will be used for this project,
		which contains 17007 strategy games from the Apple App Store as it claimed.<br>
		<br>
		For this project,
		we can explore a large number of mobile strategy grams,<br>
		find the connections between user ratings and other features,
		discover how the games developed,<br>
		study which feature has the largest influence on user evaluation,
		and how the price will affect the popularity of the games.

		<h2>Distribution of Average User Rating</h2>
		<svg id="bar-rating-freq" width="960" height="485"></svg>
		<script src="bar-rating-freq.js"></script>
		<p>
			It turns out that among all the mobile strategy games,<br>
			average ratings with 4.5 took the largest proportion, which is about 1/3;<br>
			rating with 4 took the second place;<br>
			and the number of mobile strategy games with average rating 3.5 and 5 are very close to each other.<br>
		</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Rating VS Rating Count</h2>
		<svg id="strip-rating-count" width="960" height="485"></svg>
		<script src="strip-rating-count.js"></script>
		<p>
			From the visualization above,<br>
			we can see that most games are Free but has In-app Purchase,<br>
			no matter whether its rating is high or low.<br>
			We can also find out that very few Totally Free mobile strategy games got rating 5.<br>
		</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Rating VS Count, Price, Size, Name Length</h2>
		<svg id="box-rating" width="960" height="485"></svg>
		<script src="box-rating.js"></script>
		<p>
			It is quite interesting that<br>
			there's a connection between the average user rating and the user rating count.<br>
			The average rating keeps increasing as the rating count goes up.<br>
			However, rating with 5 is an exception,<br>
			probably because as more people rates the game,<br>
			it becomes much more difficult to keep the average rating at 5 since that's the highest score we can give.<br>
			<br>
			Another interesting finding is that,<br>
			games with a very long name probably will decrease people's ratings.<br>

		<h2>Size Change for Different Genres</h2>
		<svg id="line-year-size-genre" width="960" height="485"></svg>
		<script src="line-year-size-genre.js"></script>
		<p>
			It is quite obvious that<br>
			the game size is growing larger and larger.<br>
			Let's celebrate the improvement of technology!<br>
			<br>
			And among all the selected genres,<br>
			Action seems took the most memory,<br>
			probably because action games needs dynamic pictures.<br>
