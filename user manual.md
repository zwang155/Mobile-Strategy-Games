# Mobile Strategy Games

As mobile phones plays a significant role in our daily lives nowadays, the mobile games industry is becoming more and more popular.
This project is going to do a deep dive into a dataset with multiple synchronized visualizations.

The topic is mobile strategy games.
And this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tristan581/17k-apple-app-store-strategy-games) will be used for this project, which contains 17007 strategy games from the Apple App Store as it claimed.

For this project, we can explore a large number of mobile strategy grams,
find the connections between user ratings and other features, discover how the games developed,
study which feature has the largest influence on user evaluation, and how the price will affect the popularity of the games.
